Next command: follow CI and review on PR #81.
Blockers: no new-tool blockers. Full-suite Windows limitations are recorded in report.md; OpenSpec CLI unavailable.

## Expanded run

Status: in_progress, superseding the completed initial ten-tool milestone.
Target: 50 tools / at least 40 PPA-related operations.
Acceptance: ../../../../../docs/goals/0928-tool-exploration/acceptance-50.md.
Next: clocked PPA, scalable correctness, substantive microarchitecture generators.
Remaining usage: 74%; stop below 30%. No new questions requested.

### Network and FIFO experiments

The expansion now has 23 implemented exploration operations. Use the
architecture_sweep pipeline for new combinational studies: it fingerprints
core source, inputs and measured tool versions, validates generated core and
wrapper artifacts, and rejects concurrent writers. Current network SAT coverage
is 11/12 substantial configurations; 128-bit popcount remains inconclusive.
The FIFO scoreboard checks 64/128-word storage variants against an independent
queue with protocol negative controls. FIFO physical coverage remains pending.
Do not treat a one-cycle minimum queue latency as a fixed latency.

Active physical study at this checkpoint: exec session 3537, priority encoder
64/128 bits with three paired repeats. Poll its authoritative status before
starting a duplicate. Old reduction and formal sessions are terminal; see
expanded delivery-state.md for retained errors and timeouts.
